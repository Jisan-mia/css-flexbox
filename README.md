### CSS FLEXBOX

---

**What's this?**
Flexbox is a css box model to easily layout, align and distribute space among items withing a container either horizontally or vertically.

### Before get started we need to know some of the flexbox basics:
- In flexbox, the element or container which wraps all the children elements or items is called _flexbox container_ and childrens or each children elements/items are called _flexbox items_.
- Flex container has their own properties and values
- Same goes to children, also flex items/childrens has their own properties and values
- In flexbox, there are two axis, they are _Main axis_ and _Cross axis_.
- To make a flex container `display: flex;`
- By default, `flex-direction` is row. We can change the flex-direction to
  
  ```css
  flex-direction: row || row-reverse || column || column-reverse
  ```
- When `flex-direction: column || column reverse` one thing happens here, _main axis_ come into the place of _cross axis_ and _cross axis_ take place of _main axis_
